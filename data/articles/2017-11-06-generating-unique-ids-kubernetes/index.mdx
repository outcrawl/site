This article shows how to develop a service for generating globally unique IDs on a Kubernetes cluster. IDs will be generated similarly as with Twitter's [Snowflake](https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/a/2010/announcing-snowflake.html) service, making them suitable for distributed systems where auto-incremental IDs fail and 128 bits for [UUIDs](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122.html) is too inefficient. These IDs can also be "roughly" sorted by creation time, simply by sorting them lexicographically.

For the example given, IDs will be generated inside a container running on multiple pods, exposed by a REST API service. Ideally, this mechanism would be tightly coupled inside independent services, making it highly available and not needing any centralized coordination.

# Getting started

Configure [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) to use a running Kubernetes cluster, preferably with [Minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube). Also install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/).

# Write the service

This example uses [Sonyflake](https://github.com/sony/sonyflake) package, which works similarly to Twitter's Snowflake.

Create `main.go` file and initialize Sonyflake inside `main` function.

```go
func main() {
  st := sonyflake.Settings{}
  st.MachineID = machineID
  sf := sonyflake.NewSonyflake(st)
  if sf == nil {
    log.Fatal("failed to initialize sonyflake")
  }
}
```

Write the `machineID` function, which generates a unique value by using the IP address provided with an environment variable `MY_IP`.

```go
func machineID() (uint16, error) {
  ipStr := os.Getenv("MY_IP")
  if len(ipStr) == 0 {
    return 0, errors.New("'MY_IP' environment variable not set")
  }
  ip := net.ParseIP(ipStr)
  if len(ip) < 4 {
    return 0, errors.New("invalid IP")
  }
  return uint16(ip[2])<<8 + uint16(ip[3]), nil
}
```

Back in the `main` function, set up a router with [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) web framework. It handles only one endpoint, which returns generated ID. It's returned as string to ensure no data is lost if parsing the result in JavaScript.

```go
r := gin.Default()
r.GET("/", func(c *gin.Context) {
  // Generate new ID
  id, err := sf.NextID()
  if err != nil {
    c.JSON(http.StatusInternalServerError, gin.H{
      "error": err.Error(),
    })
  } else {
    // Return ID as string
    c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{
      "id": fmt.Sprint(id),
    })
  }
})
if err := r.Run(":3000"); err != nil {
  log.Fatal("failed to run server: ", err)
}
```

# Build Docker image

Create a `Dockerfile` file.

```dockerfile
FROM golang:1.9.2

WORKDIR /go/src/app
# Copies only "main.go" file
COPY main.go .

RUN go-wrapper download
RUN go-wrapper install

EXPOSE 3000

CMD [ "app" ]
```

If you're using Minikube, switch to its Docker daemon, otherwise you'll have to push the image to some other registry.

```bash {commandLine}
eval $(minikube docker-env)
```

Build the image. Here it is named `local/unique-id`.

```bash {commandLine}
docker build -t local/unique-id .
```

# Deploy to Kubernetes

Create a configuration `deployment.yaml` file for the Kubernetes Deployment object.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1beta2
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: unique-id
  labels:
    app: unique-id
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: unique-id
  replicas: 3
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: unique-id
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: unique-id
          image: local/unique-id
          imagePullPolicy: Never
          ports:
            - containerPort: 3000
          env:
            - name: MY_IP
              valueFrom:
                fieldRef:
                  fieldPath: status.podIP
```

The `image` field is set to `local/unique-id` and `imagePullPolicy` is set to `Never`, which makes Kubernetes use the local image from the Minikube's Docker registry. The `MY_IP` environment variable is set to pod's IP using [Downward API](https://lukemarsden.github.io/docs/user-guide/downward-api/).

Declare a service inside `service.yaml`, which targets pods labelled `unique-id`.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: unique-id
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    app: unique-id
  ports:
    - port: 3000
```

Create resources.

```bash {commandLine}
kubectl create -f deployment.yaml
kubectl create -f service.yaml
```

Get the URL of the service.

```bash {commandLine}
minikube service unique-id --url
```

Finally, try calling it a couple of times.

```bash {commandLine:2-4}
curl $(minikube service unique-id --url)
{
  "id": "168514248039727104"
}
```

# Wrapping up

Following this approach for each separate service that depends on globally unique IDs, allows for perfectly distributed generation of IDs. You can find slightly modified version of the example above on [GitHub](https://github.com/tinrab/makaroni/tree/master/utilities/unique-id).
